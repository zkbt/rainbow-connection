'''
This setup.py file sets up our package to be installable on any computer,
so that folks can `import rainbowconnection` from within any directory.

Thanks to this file, you can...

...tell python to look for code in the current directory (which you
can continue to edit), by typing *one* of the following commands:

`pip install -e .`
or
`python setup.py develop`

...move a copy of this code to your site-packages directory, where python will
be able to find it (but you won't be able to keep editing it), by typing *one*
of the following commands:

`pip install .`
or
`python setup.py install`

...upload the entire package to the Python Package Index, so that other folks
will be able to install your package via the simple `pip install rainbow-connection`, by
running the following command:

`python setup.py release`


The template for this setup.py came was pieced together with help from
barentsen, christinahedges, timothydmorton, and dfm. Check them out on github
for more neat tricks!

[`python-packaging`](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
is a pretty useful resource too!
