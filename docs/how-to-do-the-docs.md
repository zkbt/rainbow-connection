# how to use mkdocs

Zach is new to mkdocs, but it seems easier than sphinx, so he's keen to try it out. Trying to follow christinahedges's very useful tutorial [here](https://christinahedges.github.io/astronomy_workflow/notebooks/3.0-building/mkdocs.html), here's what we're doing:

First, `poetry` felt a little scary for one day, so I'm trying to do this just with pip installing the things I need:
`pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocstrings 'pytkdocs[numpy-style]' mkdocs-jupyter`

Then, we set up the docs by going into the base directory for this repository, and running
`mkdocs new .`
which made a `docs/` directory and a `mkdocs.yml`

Then, we copied her template into the `docs/index.md` file and made appropriate changes for names.

Then, we edited the `docs/api.md` file to point to the objects and methods we want to explain.

Then, we used the `mkdocs-jupyter` plugin to be able use jupyter notebooks as the source for writing docs, following the examples on their pages. We added some notebooks to the `docs/` directory and pointed to them in the `mkdocs.yml` file.

Then, we ran `mkdocs serve`, and woah, a live version of the docs appeared at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. It was particularly cool (and way better than `sphinx` that I could make a change to any of the files and simply reload the page to see them update live into the docs). Hooray!

Then, we ran `mkdocs gh-deploy`, and double woah, it deployed a pretty version of the docs up at zkbt.github.io/chromatic!
